    <h2>About CK Film & Entertainment</h2>
    <p>CK Film and Entertainment was founded in November of 2024 by filmmaker Kenny Scott Guffey and producer Chris Hooten, with a goal to make “indie” mean innovative when it came to film and projects; with fresh new ideas, new concepts, and with a focus on ensemble productions.</p>

    <p>The first project from CK was a performance of Tom Holland’s Fright Night which was advertised in New York City’s Times Square, and broadcast live on Kings of Horror. The company’s billboard ad was featured in Yahoo News shortly after. </p>
        
    <p>Chris brings the business-acumen and financing to the company, allowing Kenny to focus on the creative side, while working in tandem to build a league of extraordinary individuals who are skilled in their craft, their knowledge, and their know-how to create magic, both in front of, and behind the camera. </p>
